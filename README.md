# Who Tests the Tests? An Introduction to Mutation Testing with Infection

This repository contains all the code for The Engineering Coach YouTube video, "Who Tests the Tests? An Introduction to Mutation Testing with Infection (PHP)".

In this video, we dive into the world of Mutation Testing with Infection, a powerful PHP framework. This project demonstrates how mutation testing can help you measure the quality of your tests, not just your code coverage.

## What You'll Learn

  - The core concept of mutation testing and why it matters.
  - How to use Infection to "mutant test" your code.
  - The difference between a "killed" and "escaped" mutant.
  - How to use the results from Infection to improve your tests.
